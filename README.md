Inspiration

I started tracking my readings in the year of 2018. A quick glance over the list show that the majority of books I have read were written by White men. The reason being
In the past years I have gravitated towards publications that were considered best sellers or books by authors whose work I was already familiar with. 

Being south east Asian (and European) myself I wanted to incorporate more books by Writers who share my ethnicity. 

I aspire to be a data analyst and as my very first project for my portfolio I wanted to work On a topic that I am passionate about to secure the element of joy which will eventually power my learning process so I can improve my ability.
